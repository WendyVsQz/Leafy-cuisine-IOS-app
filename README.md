### VEGAN FOOD RECIPE APP

A vegan recipe app available for IOS and maybe in the future for Android

In the menu tab you can find a whole bunch of recipes you can search for and in each of them you can find the instructions along some step by step video tutorials, moving to the nav bar you can notice a couple of options, such as your favourite meals, categories and the ability to create new recipes.
